        The gym. A place of legend, of iron, sweat, and suspiciously loud grunting. For years, it was a foreign land I observed only through the glass of social media stories. But last week, armed with a new pair of shoes and a level of anxiety usually reserved for final exams, I walked through the sliding doors. It was... an experience.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Day 1: The Intimidation Tour</h2>
    <p>
        The first day was less about working out and more about a self-guided tour of every machine I was too scared to use. The free weights area seemed to be governed by a silent, muscular council that I was not yet invited to join. I found a treadmill in a quiet corner and walked. Then I walked a little faster. I called it a success because I didn't trip.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Day 2: The Discovery of Soreness</h2>
    <p>
        Feeling emboldened, I tried some of the weight machines. The ones with diagrams. I followed the little pictures, pushed some things, pulled some others, and felt pretty good about it. The next morning, I discovered muscles I didn't know I had, mostly because they were all screaming at me in unison. Getting out of bed was a new athletic event.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Day 3: Finding a Rhythm</h2>
    <p>
        By the third day, something shifted. The soreness was still there, but it felt less like an injury and more like a receipt for the work I'd put in. I returned to the same machines, a little more confident this time. I even made eye contact with someone in the free weights section. They didn't say anything, but I'm pretty sure it was a nod of approval. Or maybe they were just looking at the clock behind me. Either way, it felt like progress.

        It's been awkward, confusing, and painful, but it's also been rewarding. I'm starting to understand that nobody really cares what you're doing, as long as you wipe down the equipment. And that's a lesson I can definitely live with.
