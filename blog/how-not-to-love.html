        People talk about love like it’s the most natural thing in the world. As if it flows, as if it fixes, as if it makes life brighter. But no one really talks about the other side—the weight, the silence, the discipline it takes to not let yourself collapse into it again. This isn’t about how to love. This is about how <em>not</em> to. And I wish someone had written it for me earlier, because I had to learn it the hard way.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Rule 1: Don’t Reach First, No Matter What</h2>
    <p>
        The urge to reach out is poison. It feels like care, but it’s really weakness dressed up as kindness. You tell yourself, “I’ll just check if they’re okay. Just one message. Just this once.” But that “once” grows teeth. Soon, you’re standing there with empty hands, waiting for crumbs that never come. So I made a rule—if they don’t reach out, I won’t either. Not today, not tomorrow, not even years from now. I’d rather die with the words stuck in my throat than throw them into a silence that doesn’t want me. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Rule 2: Don’t Mistake Memory for a Signal</h2>
    <p>
        You’ll see a place you once walked together. A song will hit out of nowhere. You’ll remember the way they laughed, the way they said your name like it meant something. And for a second, it feels alive again, like maybe it’s a sign. It’s not. It’s just your brain replaying old footage on loop. Memory is not a door. It’s a cage if you start believing it means something more. So I remind myself: nostalgia isn’t an invitation, it’s a trap.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Rule 3: Don’t Replace, Don’t Distract</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone will say, “Move on, find someone else, time heals everything.” But what they don’t get is—you can’t just swap out a person like a playlist. You can’t overwrite loyalty with convenience. For me, loving someone else while my heart still aches for the first one feels like betrayal. Not to them—hell, they probably don’t even care—but to myself. So I don’t. I refuse. I’d rather sit with the loneliness, stare it in the face, let it burn holes in me, than drag someone innocent into the mess. Because that’s not love. That’s selfishness. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Rule 4: Don’t Let Love Define Every Corner</h2>
    <p>
        The biggest mistake is making them the center of every thought. Studying so maybe they’ll be proud. Working on yourself so maybe they’ll notice. Holding back tears because maybe they’ll think you’re strong. That’s slavery. And it’s pathetic. I don’t want to live like that. So I force myself to claim moments back. I study for me, even if I fail. I laugh at something stupid, even if no one’s watching. I go to the gym and break myself apart with iron, not for them, not for anyone—just to prove I’m still mine. Because if I lose myself while holding on to them, then what’s left?
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Rule 5: Don’t Wait for Closure</h2>
    <p>
        Closure is a lie. You’ll never get the perfect explanation, the clean ending, the final conversation that makes sense of it all. Waiting for closure is waiting for Godot—it never shows up. What you really wait for is permission to let go. But here’s the raw truth: no one gives you that permission but you. So I stopped waiting. I accept the mess. The questions will stay unanswered. The story doesn’t need a neat bow. It ends where it ends, even if it doesn’t feel fair.

    <p class="mt-6">
        Loving is easy. Anyone can fall, anyone can cling. What’s hard is the discipline of restraint. To wake up every day and <em>not</em> send that message. To let the memory pass like smoke instead of breathing it in. To live without trying to replace, without hoping for closure, without handing over your whole self again. That’s how not to love. And maybe, in some twisted way, it’s the only kind of love that doesn’t break me anymore—the one I keep locked inside, for myself, and no one else.
